Flysystem is a filesystem abstraction which allows you to easily swap out a local filesystem for a remote one.
Flysystem is originally designed and developed in PHP, see https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem.
This repo is a Java implementation of Flysystem.

This currently is VERY alpha. Please see the tests on what is currently implemented.
